# About

The ``pytemscript`` package provides a Python wrapper for both standard and advanced scripting
interfaces of Thermo Fisher Scientific and FEI microscopes. The functionality is
limited to the functionality of the original scripting interfaces. For detailed information
about TEM scripting see the documentation accompanying your microscope.

The ``pytemscript`` package provides two interfaces to the microscope. The first one
corresponds directly to the COM interface. The other interface is a more high level interface.
Within the ``pytemscript`` package three implementation for the high level interface are provided,
one for running scripts directly on the microscope PC, one to run scripts remotely over network, and
finally a dummy implementation for offline development & testing exists.

Currently the ``pytemscript`` package requires Python 3.4 or higher. The current plan is to keep the minimum
supported Python version at 3.4, since this is the latest Python version supporting Windows XP.

This is a GPL fork of the original BSD-licensed project: https://github.com/niermann/temscript
New changes and this whole product is distributed under either version 3 of the GPL License, or
(at your option) any later version.

# Documentation

The documentation can be found at https://pytemscript.readthedocs.io/ (tbd)

# Installation

Requirements:
* python >= 3.4
* comtypes
* mrcfile and numpy (optional, only to save images in mrc format)
* sphinx-rtd-theme (optional, only for building documentation)
* matplotlib (optional, only for running tests)

### Installation from PyPI on Windows (using pip)

This assumes you have connection to the internet. 

Execute from the command line (assuming you have your Python interpreter in the path):
    
    py -m pip install --upgrade pip
    py -m pip install pytemscript

### Offline-Installation from wheels file on Windows (using pip)

This assumes you have downloaded the wheels file <downloaded-wheels-file>.whl for temscript and comtypes into the current folder.

Execute from the command line (assuming you have your Python interpreter in the path:
    
    py -m pip install numpy comtypes pytemscript --no-index --find-links .

If you want to install pytemscript from sources (you still need to download comtypes *.whl):
    
    py -m pip install numpy comtypes --no-index --find-links .
    py -m pip install -e <source_directory>
